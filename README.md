# FMBQ Jump Lights
This is a free, open-source online set of jump lights, designed for use by competitors in the Free Methodist Bible Quizzing competition. 
While not legal in actual matches, this web application is useful for casually practicing with 2-6 quizzers; it requires only a screen and a QWERTY [standard] keyboard to run, where a traditional set of lights requires six chairs, six pressure sensors, a box of lights, and quite a bit of wiring.

## What do "jump lights" do?
In Free Methodist Bible Quizzing, jump lights are used to register which of a group of players ("quizzers") "jumps" first. This is used in competitions to determine the order in which quizzers are allowed to answer given questions!
On a classic set of lights, there are literal pressure sensors placed on chairs, from which quizzers literally jump. However, in this application, each chair is simulated by a single key, and pressing/releasing that button is registered as jumping/sitting.

## Instructions
- First, open the website and enter the names of each team and quizzer that is playing.
- Second, once all names are entered, click or tap the portion of the screen that is not a text box (e.g. in the middle).
- When ready to quiz, have each quizzer put one finger on the key that appears to the side of their name. When pressing this key, they are "sitting"; to "jump", they must release it.
- To reset after a jump, have all quizzers "sit" by pressing their respective keys.
